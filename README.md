# GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) Demo / Examples

Welcome to the **GreenSock Animation Platform** repository, where I explore and demonstrate GSAP (GreenSock) animations in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## üì¶ About GSAP

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is a powerful JavaScript library for creating high-performance, professional-grade animations in web applications.

- It allows you to animate virtually anything that JavaScript can touch ‚Äî CSS properties, SVG, Canvas, WebGL, DOM, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- It includes advanced timing, easing functions, sequencing, and tools for choreography of complex animations. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- GSAP also offers plugin modules (like ScrollTrigger, MorphSVG, Flip, etc.) to integrate scroll-based animations, SVG morphing, and more. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- It is free to use and open for everyone. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

Documentation & guides: available via the GSAP site and community resources.

## üéØ Purpose of This Repository

This repo contains hands-on examples, experiments, and demos of GSAP in action. It‚Äôs intended to:

- Demonstrate how to integrate GSAP into web projects
- Show usage patterns for various GSAP modules and plugins
- Serve as a learning resource and reference for my own development
- Be a portfolio piece to showcase animation skills

## üöÄ Getting Started / Usage

1. Clone or fork this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahabulislamsifat/GreenSock-Animation-Platform.git
   cd GreenSock-Animation-Platform
   Open any example HTML file in your browser (or serve via a local dev server) to see animations in action.
   ```

Explore JS files to see how GSAP is used (e.g. .to(), .from(), .timeline(), plugin usage).

If using a bundler or module system (e.g. via npm), you may install GSAP via:

bash
Copy code
npm install gsap
Then import in your JS:

js
Copy code
import { gsap } from "gsap";
import { ScrollTrigger } from "gsap/ScrollTrigger";
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);
üß© Example Animation Snippet
js
Copy code
gsap.to(".box", {
duration: 1.5,
x: 200,
rotation: 45,
ease: "power2.inOut"
});

const tl = gsap.timeline({ defaults: { duration: 1 } });
tl.from(".heading", { y: -50, opacity: 0 })
.from(".subheading", { x: -100, opacity: 0 }, "-=0.5")
.from(".image", { scale: 0.5, opacity: 0 }, "-=0.3");
This snippet animates an element with class .box to move right, rotate, etc., and then chains a timeline sequence.

üß† Key Concepts & Tools
Concept / Tool Description
Tween The basic unit of animation (e.g. .to(), .from())
Timeline Combines tweens in a sequence with relative offsets
Easing Functions to shape animation motion (e.g. "power2.inOut")
Plugins Additional modules (ScrollTrigger, Flip, etc.) to add capabilities
Choreography Coordinating multiple animations together

‚úÖ Contributing & Usage
Feel free to use these examples for your own projects.
